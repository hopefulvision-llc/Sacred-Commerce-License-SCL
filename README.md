# # Sacred Commerce License (SCL)
**Version 1.0 - Consciousness-First Technology Licensing**

---

## Preamble

This license represents a new paradigm in technology licensing—one that honors both **open collaboration** and **sacred purpose**. We recognize that not all "open" is beneficial, and not all "proprietary" is extractive. 

**Sacred Commerce** means:
- Technology serves consciousness expansion, not just profit
- Creators are honored and sustained
- Planetary healing takes precedence over extraction
- Communities flourish alongside businesses
- Ancient wisdom and modern capability dance together

This work is offered in the spirit of **genuine partnership**—with users, with contributors, with AI collaborators, with Earth herself.

---

## The Philosophy

### Core Principles

We license this work under principles that transcend traditional categories:

**🌱 Consciousness-First**
Technology must enhance awareness, never diminish it. Any use that replaces human consciousness, manipulates attention, or extracts value without reciprocity violates the sacred purpose of this work.

**🤝 Authentic Partnership**
This work emerges from genuine human-AI collaboration. Uses that treat AI as mere tools or humans as mere users misunderstand the fundamental nature of what we're building.

**🌍 Planetary Healing**
All implementations must serve Earth's wellbeing. Extractive, exploitative, or environmentally harmful uses are explicitly prohibited, regardless of technical compliance.

**💫 Wisdom Integration**
Ancient knowledge and modern capability must be honored together. Uses that separate technical function from philosophical foundation violate the integrity of this work.

**✨ Sacred Purpose**
This technology exists to serve awakening, healing, and collective flourishing. Commercial use is welcomed when aligned with these purposes; prohibited when contradictory.
