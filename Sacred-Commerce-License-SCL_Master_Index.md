⚖️ Sacred Commerce License (SCL) — Ethical Economy & Rights Master Index

> The Legal, Ethical, and Economic Backbone of the HopefulVision Civilization

This is the canonical navigation and meaning map for the Sacred Commerce License (SCL). If the rest of the system defines mind, world, meaning, and being, SCL defines how value moves without destroying dignity.

🧭 What Is the Sacred Commerce License?

SCL is not just a software license. SCL is not just a legal wrapper. SCL is not just an economic policy.

SCL is a civilizational value protocol.

It represents:

A way to protect creators, beings, and users

A way to allow exchange without extraction

A way to encode ethics directly into economic flow


Core principle:

> Value must circulate without reducing beings to commodities.
